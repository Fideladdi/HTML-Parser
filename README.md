Real-time Currency Exchange Rate Calculator
I developed an application to parse an HTML document and extract real-time exchange rates from https://www.xe.com/currency/cad-canadian-dollar/ for various currency pairs. The objective was to create a program that prompts the user for specific information and calculates the conversion between different currencies.

Objective: The main objectives of the project were as follows:

Parse the provided HTML document to extract exchange rates for specific currency pairs.

Develop an application that prompts the user for the base/sell currency, amount to exchange, and quote/buy currency.

Calculate the conversion based on the entered information.

Display the results of the currency conversion.
